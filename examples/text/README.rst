Text domain
============

Text-domain metrics are essential for evaluating the performance of models in tasks like text classification, summarization, and translation. TorchMetrics provides a suite of specialized metrics designed for these purposes. Using these text-specific metrics from Torch Metrics helps in developing more precise and robust text-based models, ensuring that performance evaluations are both meaningful and directly applicable to practical NLP tasks.
