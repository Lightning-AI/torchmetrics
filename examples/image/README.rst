Image domain
============

Image-domain metrics are pivotal for gauging the performance of models in tasks like object detection, and segmentation. TorchMetrics provides a suite of specialized metrics designed for these purposes. Using these image-specific metrics from Torch Metrics helps in developing more precise and robust image-based models, ensuring that performance evaluations are both meaningful and directly applicable to practical vision tasks.
