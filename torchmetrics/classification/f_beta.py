class FBeta(StatScores):
    r"""
    Computes `F-score <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score>`_, specifically:

    .. math::
        F_\beta = (1 + \beta^2) * \frac{\text{precision} * \text{recall}}
        {(\beta^2 * \text{precision}) + \text{recall}}

    Where :math:`\beta` is some positive real factor. Works with binary, multiclass, and multilabel data.
    Accepts logit scores or probabilities from a model output or integer class values in prediction.
    Works with multi-dimensional preds and target.

    Forward accepts

    - ``preds`` (float or long tensor): ``(N, ...)`` or ``(N, C, ...)`` where C is the number of classes
    - ``target`` (long tensor): ``(N, ...)``

    If preds and target are the same shape and preds is a float tensor, we use the ``self.threshold`` argument
    to convert into integer labels. This is the case for binary and multi-label logits and probabilities.

    If preds has an extra dimension as in the case of multi-class scores we perform an argmax on ``dim=1``.

    Args:
        num_classes:
            Number of classes. Necessary for ``'macro'``, ``'weighted'`` and ``None`` average methods.
        beta:
            Beta coefficient in the F measure.
        threshold:
            Threshold for transforming probability or logit predictions to binary (0,1) predictions, in the case
            of binary or multi-label inputs. Default value of 0.5 corresponds to input being probabilities.
        average:
            Defines the reduction that is applied. Should be one of the following:

            - ``'micro'`` [default]: Calculate the metric globally, across all samples and classes.
            - ``'macro'``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and average the
              metrics across classes (with equal weights for each class).
            - ``'weighted'``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and average the
              metrics across classes, weighting each class by its support (``tp + fn``).
            - ``'none'`` or ``None``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and return
              the metric for every class.
            - ``'samples'``: Calculate the metric for each sample, and average the metrics
              across samples (with equal weights for each sample).

            .. note:: What is considered a sample in the multi-dimensional multi-class case
                depends on the value of ``mdmc_average``.

            .. note:: If ``'none'`` and a given class doesn't occur in the `preds` or `target`,
                the value for the class will be ``nan``.

        mdmc_average:
            Defines how averaging is done for multi-dimensional multi-class inputs (on top of the
            ``average`` parameter). Should be one of the following:

            - ``None`` [default]: Should be left unchanged if your data is not multi-dimensional
              multi-class.

            - ``'samplewise'``: In this case, the statistics are computed separately for each
              sample on the ``N`` axis, and then averaged over samples.
              The computation for each sample is done by treating the flattened extra axes ``...``
              (see :ref:`references/modules:input types`) as the ``N`` dimension within the sample,
              and computing the metric for the sample based on that.

            - ``'global'``: In this case the ``N`` and ``...`` dimensions of the inputs
              (see :ref:`references/modules:input types`)
              are flattened into a new ``N_X`` sample axis, i.e. the inputs are treated as if they
              were ``(N_X, C)``. From here on the ``average`` parameter applies as usual.

        ignore_index:
            Integer specifying a target class to ignore. If given, this class index does not contribute
            to the returned score, regardless of reduction method. If an index is ignored, and ``average=None``
            or ``'none'``, the score for the ignored class will be returned as ``nan``.

        top_k:
            Number of highest probability or logit score predictions considered to find the correct label,
            relevant only for (multi-dimensional) multi-class inputs. The
            default value (``None``) will be interpreted as 1 for these inputs.

            Should be left at default (``None``) for all other types of inputs.

        multiclass:
            Used only in certain special cases, where you want to treat inputs as a different type
            than what they appear to be. See the parameter's
            :ref:`documentation section <references/modules:using the multiclass parameter>`
            for a more detailed explanation and examples.

        compute_on_step:
            Forward only calls ``update()`` and return ``None`` if this is set to ``False``.
        dist_sync_on_step:
            Synchronize metric state across processes at each ``forward()``
            before returning the value at the step
        process_group:
            Specify the process group on which synchronization is called.
            default: ``None`` (which selects the entire world)
        dist_sync_fn:
            Callback that performs the allgather operation on the metric state. When ``None``, DDP
            will be used to perform the allgather.
        multilabel:
            .. deprecated:: 0.3
                Argument will not have any effect and will be removed in v0.4, please use ``multiclass`` intead.

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If ``average`` is none of ``"micro"``, ``"macro"``, ``"weighted"``, ``"none"``, ``None``.

    Example:
        >>> from torchmetrics import FBeta
        >>> target = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2])
        >>> preds = torch.tensor([0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1])
