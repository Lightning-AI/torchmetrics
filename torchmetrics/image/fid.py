class FID(Metric):
    r"""
    Calculates `Fréchet inception distance (FID) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_inception_distance>`_
    which is used to access the quality of generated images. Given by

    .. math::
        FID = |\mu - \mu_w| + tr(\Sigma + \Sigma_w - 2(\Sigma \Sigma_w)^{\frac{1}{2}})

    where :math:`\mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)` is the multivariate normal distribution estimated from Inception v3 [1]
    features calculated on real life images and :math:`\mathcal{N}(\mu_w, \Sigma_w)` is the multivariate normal
    distribution estimated from Inception v3 features calculated on generated (fake) images. The metric was
    originally proposed in [1].

    Using the default feature extraction (Inception v3 using the original weights from [2]), the input is
    expected to be mini-batches of 3-channel RGB images of shape (3 x H x W) with dtype uint8. All images
    will be resized to 299 x 299 which is the size of the original training data. The boolian flag ``real``
    determines if the images should update the statistics of the real distribution or the fake distribution.

    .. note:: using this metric with the default feature extractor requires that ``torch-fidelity``
        is installed. Either install as ``pip install torchmetrics[image-quality]`` or
        ``pip install torch-fidelity``

    .. note:: the ``forward`` method can be used but ``compute_on_step`` is disabled by default (oppesit of
        all other metrics) as this metric does not really make sense to calculate on a single batch. This
        means that by default ``forward`` will just call ``update`` underneat.

    Args:
        feature:
            Either an integer or ``nn.Module``:

            - an integer will indicate the inceptionv3 feature layer to choose. Can be one of the following:
              64, 192, 768, 2048
            - an ``nn.Module`` for using a custom feature extractor. Expects that its forward method returns
              an ``[N,d]`` matrix where ``N`` is the batch size and ``d`` is the feature size.

        compute_on_step:
            Forward only calls ``update()`` and return ``None`` if this is set to ``False``.
        dist_sync_on_step:
            Synchronize metric state across processes at each ``forward()``
            before returning the value at the step
        process_group:
            Specify the process group on which synchronization is called.
            default: ``None`` (which selects the entire world)
        dist_sync_fn:
            Callback that performs the allgather operation on the metric state. When ``None``, DDP
            will be used to perform the allgather
