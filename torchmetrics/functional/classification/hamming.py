def hamming_distance(preds: Tensor, target: Tensor, threshold: float = 0.5) -> Tensor:
    r"""
    Computes the average `Hamming distance`_ (also
    known as Hamming loss) between targets and predictions:

    .. math::
        \text{Hamming distance} = \frac{1}{N \cdot L} \sum_i^N \sum_l^L 1(y_{il} \neq \hat{y}_{il})

    Where :math:`y` is a tensor of target values, :math:`\hat{y}` is a tensor of predictions,
    and :math:`\bullet_{il}` refers to the :math:`l`-th label of the :math:`i`-th sample of that
    tensor.

    This is the same as ``1-accuracy`` for binary data, while for all other types of inputs it
    treats each possible label separately - meaning that, for example, multi-class data is
    treated as if it were multi-label.

    Accepts all input types listed in :ref:`pages/classification:input types`.

    Args:
        preds: Predictions from model (probabilities, logits or labels)
        target: Ground truth
        threshold:
            Threshold for transforming probability or logit predictions to binary (0,1) predictions, in the case
            of binary or multi-label inputs. Default value of 0.5 corresponds to input being probabilities.

    Example:
        >>> from torchmetrics.functional import hamming_distance
        >>> target = torch.tensor([[0, 1], [1, 1]])
        >>> preds = torch.tensor([[0, 1], [0, 1]])
        >>> hamming_distance(preds, target)
        tensor(0.2500)

    correct, total = _hamming_distance_update(preds, target, threshold)
