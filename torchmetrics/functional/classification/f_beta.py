        {(\beta^2 * \text{precision}) + \text{recall}}

    Works with binary, multiclass, and multilabel data.
    Accepts probabilities or logits from a model output or integer class values in prediction.
    Works with multi-dimensional preds and target.

    If preds and target are the same shape and preds is a float tensor, we use the ``self.threshold`` argument
    to convert into integer labels. This is the case for binary and multi-label logits or probabilities.

    If preds has an extra dimension as in the case of multi-class scores we perform an argmax on ``dim=1``.

    The reduction method (how the precision scores are aggregated) is controlled by the
    ``average`` parameter, and additionally by the ``mdmc_average`` parameter in the
    multi-dimensional multi-class case. Accepts all inputs listed in :ref:`references/modules:input types`.

    Args:
        preds: Predictions from model (probabilities, logits or labels)
        target: Ground truth values
        average:
            Defines the reduction that is applied. Should be one of the following:

                - ``'micro'`` [default]: Calculate the metric globally, across all samples and classes.
                - ``'macro'``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and average the
                  metrics across classes (with equal weights for each class).
                - ``'weighted'``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and average the
                  metrics across classes, weighting each class by its support (``tp + fn``).
                - ``'none'`` or ``None``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and return
                  the metric for every class.
                - ``'samples'``: Calculate the metric for each sample, and average the metrics
                  across samples (with equal weights for each sample).

            .. note:: What is considered a sample in the multi-dimensional multi-class case
                depends on the value of ``mdmc_average``.

            .. note:: If ``'none'`` and a given class doesn't occur in the `preds` or `target`,
                the value for the class will be ``nan``.

        mdmc_average:
            Defines how averaging is done for multi-dimensional multi-class inputs (on top of the
            ``average`` parameter). Should be one of the following:

                - ``None`` [default]: Should be left unchanged if your data is not multi-dimensional
                  multi-class.
                - ``'samplewise'``: In this case, the statistics are computed separately for each
                  sample on the ``N`` axis, and then averaged over samples.
                  The computation for each sample is done by treating the flattened extra axes ``...``
                  (see :ref:`references/modules:input types`) as the ``N`` dimension within the sample,
                  and computing the metric for the sample based on that.
                - ``'global'``: In this case the ``N`` and ``...`` dimensions of the inputs
                  (see :ref:`references/modules:input types`)
                  are flattened into a new ``N_X`` sample axis, i.e. the inputs are treated as if they
                  were ``(N_X, C)``. From here on the ``average`` parameter applies as usual.

        ignore_index:
            Integer specifying a target class to ignore. If given, this class index does not contribute
            to the returned score, regardless of reduction method. If an index is ignored, and ``average=None``
            or ``'none'``, the score for the ignored class will be returned as ``nan``.
        num_classes:
            Number of classes. Necessary for ``'macro'``, ``'weighted'`` and ``None`` average methods.
        threshold:
            Threshold for transforming probability or logit predictions to binary (0,1) predictions, in the case
            of binary or multi-label inputs. Default value of 0.5 corresponds to input being probabilities.
        top_k:
            Number of highest probability or logit score predictions considered to find the correct label,
            relevant only for (multi-dimensional) multi-class inputs. The
            default value (``None``) will be interpreted as 1 for these inputs.

            Should be left at default (``None``) for all other types of inputs.
        multiclass:
            Used only in certain special cases, where you want to treat inputs as a different type
            than what they appear to be. See the parameter's
            :ref:`documentation section <references/modules:using the multiclass parameter>`
            for a more detailed explanation and examples.
        multilabel:
            .. deprecated:: 0.3
                Argument will not have any effect and will be removed in v0.4, please use ``multiclass`` intead.

    Return:
        The shape of the returned tensor depends on the ``average`` parameter

        - If ``average in ['micro', 'macro', 'weighted', 'samples']``, a one-element tensor will be returned
        - If ``average in ['none', None]``, the shape will be ``(C,)``, where ``C`` stands  for the number
          of classes
