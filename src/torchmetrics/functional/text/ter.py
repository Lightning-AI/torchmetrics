    """Calculate Translation edit rate (`TER`_)  of machine translated text with one or more references.

    This implementation follows the implementations from
    https://github.com/mjpost/sacrebleu/blob/master/sacrebleu/metrics/ter.py. The `sacrebleu` implementation is a
    near-exact reimplementation of the Tercom algorithm, produces identical results on all "sane" outputs.

    Args:
        preds: An iterable of hypothesis corpus.
        target: An iterable of iterables of reference corpus.
        normalize: An indication whether a general tokenization to be applied.
        no_punctuation: An indication whteher a punctuation to be removed from the sentences.
        lowercase: An indication whether to enable case-insensitivity.
        asian_support: An indication whether asian characters to be processed.
        return_sentence_level_score: An indication whether a sentence-level TER to be returned.

    Return:
        A corpus-level translation edit rate (TER).
        (Optionally) A list of sentence-level translation_edit_rate (TER) if `return_sentence_level_score=True`.

    Example:
        >>> preds = ['the cat is on the mat']
        >>> target = [['there is a cat on the mat', 'a cat is on the mat']]
        >>> translation_edit_rate(preds, target)
