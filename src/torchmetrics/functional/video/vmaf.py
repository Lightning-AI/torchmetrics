    """Calculates Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF) metric.

    VMAF is a full-reference video quality assessment algorithm that combines multiple quality assessment features
    such as detail loss, motion, and contrast using a machine learning model to predict human perception of video
    quality more accurately than traditional metrics like PSNR or SSIM.

    The metric works by:

       1. Converting input videos to luma component (grayscale)
       2. Computing multiple elementary features:
          - Additive Detail Measure (ADM): Evaluates detail preservation at different scales
          - Visual Information Fidelity (VIF): Measures preservation of visual information across frequency bands
          - Motion: Quantifies the amount of motion in the video
       3. Combining these features using a trained SVM model to predict quality

    .. note::
        This implementation requires you to have vmaf-torch installed: https://github.com/alvitrioliks/VMAF-torch.
        Install either by cloning the repository and running `pip install .` or with `pip install torchmetrics[video]`.

    Args:
        preds: Video tensor of shape (batch, channels, frames, height, width). Expected to be in RGB format
            with values in range [0, 1].
        target: Video tensor of shape (batch, channels, frames, height, width). Expected to be in RGB format
            with values in range [0, 1].
        features: If True, all the elementary features (ADM, VIF, motion) are returned along with the VMAF score in
            a dictionary. This corresponds to the output you would get from the VMAF command line tool with the `--csv`
            option enabled. If False, only the VMAF score is returned as a tensor.

    Returns:
        - If `features` is False, returns a tensor with shape (batch, frame) of VMAF score for each frame in
          each video. Higher scores indicate better quality, with typical values ranging from 0 to 100.

        - If `features` is True, returns a dictionary where each value is a (batch, frame) tensor of the
          corresponding feature. The keys are:

            - 'integer_motion2': Integer motion feature
            - 'integer_motion': Integer motion feature
            - 'integer_adm2': Integer ADM feature
            - 'integer_adm_scale0': Integer ADM feature at scale 0
            - 'integer_adm_scale1': Integer ADM feature at scale 1
            - 'integer_adm_scale2': Integer ADM feature at scale 2
            - 'integer_adm_scale3': Integer ADM feature at scale 3
            - 'integer_vif_scale0': Integer VIF feature at scale 0
            - 'integer_vif_scale1': Integer VIF feature at scale 1
            - 'integer_vif_scale2': Integer VIF feature at scale 2
            - 'integer_vif_scale3': Integer VIF feature at scale 3
            - 'vmaf': VMAF score for each frame in each video
