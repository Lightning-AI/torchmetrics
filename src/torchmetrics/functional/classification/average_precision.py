    The AP score summarizes a precision-recall curve as an weighted mean of precisions at each threshold, with the

    equivalent to the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC).

    Accepts the following input tensors:

    - ``preds`` (float tensor): ``(N, ...)``. Preds should be a tensor containing probabilities or logits for each
      observation. If preds has values outside [0,1] range we consider the input to be logits and will auto apply
      sigmoid per element.
    - ``target`` (int tensor): ``(N, ...)``. Target should be a tensor containing ground truth labels, and therefore
      only contain {0,1} values (except if `ignore_index` is specified). The value 1 always encodes the positive class.

    Additional dimension ``...`` will be flattened into the batch dimension.

    The implementation both supports calculating the metric in a non-binned but accurate version and a binned version
    that is less accurate but more memory efficient. Setting the `thresholds` argument to `None` will activate the
    non-binned  version that uses memory of size :math:`\mathcal{O}(n_{samples})` whereas setting the `thresholds`
    argument to either an integer, list or a 1d tensor will use a binned version that uses memory of
    size :math:`\mathcal{O}(n_{thresholds})` (constant memory).

    Args:
        preds: Tensor with predictions
        target: Tensor with true labels
        thresholds:
            Can be one of:

            - If set to an `int` (larger than 1), will use that number of thresholds linearly spaced from
              0 to 1 as bins for the calculation.
            - If set to an `list` of floats, will use the indicated thresholds in the list as bins for the calculation
            - If set to an 1d `tensor` of floats, will use the indicated thresholds in the tensor as
              bins for the calculation.
