    .. math:: \text{Dice} = \frac{\text{2 * TP}}{\text{2 * TP} + \text{FP} + \text{FN}}

    Where :math:`\text{TP}` and :math:`\text{FN}` represent the number of true positives and
    false negatives respecitively.

    It is recommend set `ignore_index` to index of background class.

    The reduction method (how the recall scores are aggregated) is controlled by the
    ``average`` parameter, and additionally by the ``mdmc_average`` parameter in the
    multi-dimensional multi-class case.

    Args:
        preds: Predictions from model (probabilities, logits or labels)
        target: Ground truth values
        zero_division: The value to use for the score if denominator equals zero
        average:
            Defines the reduction that is applied. Should be one of the following:

            - ``'micro'`` [default]: Calculate the metric globally, across all samples and classes.
            - ``'macro'``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and average the
              metrics across classes (with equal weights for each class).
            - ``'weighted'``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and average the
              metrics across classes, weighting each class by its support (``tp + fn``).
            - ``'none'`` or ``None``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and return
              the metric for every class.
            - ``'samples'``: Calculate the metric for each sample, and average the metrics
              across samples (with equal weights for each sample).

            .. tip::
                What is considered a sample in the multi-dimensional multi-class case
                depends on the value of ``mdmc_average``.

            .. hint::
                If ``'none'`` and a given class doesn't occur in the ``preds`` or ``target``,
                the value for the class will be ``nan``.

        mdmc_average:
            Defines how averaging is done for multi-dimensional multi-class inputs (on top of the
            ``average`` parameter). Should be one of the following:

            - ``None`` [default]: Should be left unchanged if your data is not multi-dimensional
              multi-class.

            - ``'samplewise'``: In this case, the statistics are computed separately for each
              sample on the ``N`` axis, and then averaged over samples.
              The computation for each sample is done by treating the flattened extra axes ``...``
              as the ``N`` dimension within the sample,
              and computing the metric for the sample based on that.

            - ``'global'``: In this case the ``N`` and ``...`` dimensions of the inputs
              are flattened into a new ``N_X`` sample axis, i.e. the inputs are treated as if they
              were ``(N_X, C)``. From here on the ``average`` parameter applies as usual.

        ignore_index:
            Integer specifying a target class to ignore. If given, this class index does not contribute
            to the returned score, regardless of reduction method. If an index is ignored, and ``average=None``
            or ``'none'``, the score for the ignored class will be returned as ``nan``.

        num_classes:
            Number of classes. Necessary for ``'macro'``, ``'weighted'`` and ``None`` average methods.

        threshold:
            Threshold for transforming probability or logit predictions to binary (0,1) predictions, in the case
            of binary or multi-label inputs. Default value of 0.5 corresponds to input being probabilities.
        top_k:
            Number of the highest probability or logit score predictions considered finding the correct label,
            relevant only for (multi-dimensional) multi-class inputs. The
            default value (``None``) will be interpreted as 1 for these inputs.

            Should be left at default (``None``) for all other types of inputs.
        multiclass:
            Used only in certain special cases, where you want to treat inputs as a different type
            than what they appear to be.

    .. warning::
        The ``dice`` metrics is being deprecated from the classification subpackage in v1.6.0 of torchmetrics and will
        be removed in v1.7.0. Please instead consider using ``f1score`` metric from the classification subpackage as it
        provides the same functionality. Additionally, we are going to re-add the ``dice`` metric in the segmentation
        domain in v1.6.0 with slight modifications to functionality.

    Return:
        The shape of the returned tensor depends on the ``average`` parameter

        - If ``average in ['micro', 'macro', 'weighted', 'samples']``, a one-element tensor will be returned
        - If ``average in ['none', None]``, the shape will be ``(C,)``, where ``C`` stands  for the number of classes

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If ``average`` is not one of ``"micro"``, ``"macro"``, ``"weighted"``, ``"samples"``, ``"none"`` or ``None``
        ValueError:
            If ``mdmc_average`` is not one of ``None``, ``"samplewise"``, ``"global"``.
        ValueError:
            If ``average`` is set but ``num_classes`` is not provided.
        ValueError:
            If ``num_classes`` is set and ``ignore_index`` is not in the range ``[0, num_classes)``.

    Example:
        >>> from torchmetrics.functional.classification import dice
        >>> preds = torch.tensor([2, 0, 2, 1])
        >>> target = torch.tensor([1, 1, 2, 0])
