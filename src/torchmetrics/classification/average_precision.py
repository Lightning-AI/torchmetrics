class BinaryAveragePrecision(BinaryPrecisionRecallCurve):
    r"""Compute the average precision (AP) score for binary tasks.

    The AP score summarizes a precision-recall curve as an weighted mean of precisions at each threshold, with the
    difference in recall from the previous threshold as weight:

    .. math::
        AP = \sum_{n} (R_n - R_{n-1}) P_n

    where :math:`P_n, R_n` is the respective precision and recall at threshold index :math:`n`. This value is
    equivalent to the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC).

    As input to ``forward`` and ``update`` the metric accepts the following input:

    - ``preds`` (:class:`~torch.Tensor`): A float tensor of shape ``(N, ...)`` containing probabilities or logits for
      each observation. If preds has values outside [0,1] range we consider the input to be logits and will auto apply
      sigmoid per element.
    - ``target`` (:class:`~torch.Tensor`): An int tensor of shape ``(N, ...)`` containing ground truth labels, and
      therefore only contain {0,1} values (except if `ignore_index` is specified). The value 1 always encodes the
      positive class.

    As output to ``forward`` and ``compute`` the metric returns the following output:

    - ``bap`` (:class:`~torch.Tensor`): A single scalar with the average precision score

    Additional dimension ``...`` will be flattened into the batch dimension.

    The implementation both supports calculating the metric in a non-binned but accurate version and a binned version
    that is less accurate but more memory efficient. Setting the `thresholds` argument to `None` will activate the
    non-binned  version that uses memory of size :math:`\mathcal{O}(n_{samples})` whereas setting the `thresholds`
    argument to either an integer, list or a 1d tensor will use a binned version that uses memory of
    size :math:`\mathcal{O}(n_{thresholds})` (constant memory).

    Args:
        thresholds:
            Can be one of:

            - If set to `None`, will use a non-binned approach where thresholds are dynamically calculated from
              all the data. Most accurate but also most memory consuming approach.
            - If set to an `int` (larger than 1), will use that number of thresholds linearly spaced from
              0 to 1 as bins for the calculation.
            - If set to an `list` of floats, will use the indicated thresholds in the list as bins for the calculation
            - If set to an 1d `tensor` of floats, will use the indicated thresholds in the tensor as
              bins for the calculation.

        validate_args: bool indicating if input arguments and tensors should be validated for correctness.
            Set to ``False`` for faster computations.

class AveragePrecision:
    r"""Compute the average precision (AP) score.

    The AP score summarizes a precision-recall curve as an weighted mean of precisions at each threshold, with the
    difference in recall from the previous threshold as weight:

    .. math::
        AP = \sum_{n} (R_n - R_{n-1}) P_n

    where :math:`P_n, R_n` is the respective precision and recall at threshold index :math:`n`. This value is
    equivalent to the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC).

    This function is a simple wrapper to get the task specific versions of this metric, which is done by setting the
    ``task`` argument to either ``'binary'``, ``'multiclass'`` or ``multilabel``. See the documentation of
    :mod:`BinaryAveragePrecision`, :mod:`MulticlassAveragePrecision` and :mod:`MultilabelAveragePrecision`
    for the specific details of each argument influence and examples.

    Legacy Example:
        >>> from torch import tensor
        >>> pred = tensor([0, 0.1, 0.8, 0.4])
        >>> target = tensor([0, 1, 1, 1])
        >>> average_precision = AveragePrecision(task="binary")
        >>> average_precision(pred, target)
        tensor(1.)

        >>> pred = tensor([[0.75, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05],
        ...                [0.05, 0.75, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05],
        ...                [0.05, 0.05, 0.75, 0.05, 0.05],
        ...                [0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.75, 0.05]])
        >>> target = tensor([0, 1, 3, 2])
        >>> average_precision = AveragePrecision(task="multiclass", num_classes=5, average=None)
        >>> average_precision(pred, target)
        tensor([1.0000, 1.0000, 0.2500, 0.2500,    nan])
