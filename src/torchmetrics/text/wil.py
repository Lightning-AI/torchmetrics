class WordInfoLost(Metric):
    r"""Word Information Lost (`WIL`_) is a metric of the performance of an automatic speech recognition system.

    This value indicates the percentage of words that were incorrectly predicted between a set of ground-truth
    sentences and a set of hypothesis sentences. The lower the value, the better the performance of the ASR system
    with a WordInfoLost of 0 being a perfect score. Word Information Lost rate can then be computed as:

    .. math::
        wil = 1 - \frac{C}{N} + \frac{C}{P}

    where:

        - :math:`C` is the number of correct words,
        - :math:`N` is the number of words in the reference
        - :math:`P` is the number of words in the prediction

    As input to ``forward`` and ``update`` the metric accepts the following input:

    - ``preds`` (:class:`~List`): Transcription(s) to score as a string or list of strings
    - ``target`` (:class:`~List`): Reference(s) for each speech input as a string or list of strings

    As output of ``forward`` and ``compute`` the metric returns the following output:

    - ``wil`` (:class:`~torch.Tensor`): A tensor with the Word Information Lost score

    Args:
        kwargs: Additional keyword arguments, see :ref:`Metric kwargs` for more info.

    Examples:
        >>> from torchmetrics.text import WordInfoLost
        >>> preds = ["this is the prediction", "there is an other sample"]
        >>> target = ["this is the reference", "there is another one"]
        >>> wil = WordInfoLost()
        >>> wil(preds, target)
